Crop Production Analysis (1997-2014)  This project analyzes crop production data from 1997 to 2014, utilizing Tableau Desktop for visualization and Excel for data cleaning. The analysis provides insights into agricultural trends, seasonal production variations, state-wise production, and area vs. production efficiency for top crops. 

## Project Overview

Using Tableau Desktop, I created an interactive and insightful story to illustrate key trends and patterns in crop production:

- **Trend Analysis Over the Years**: Observed a steady increase in production, peaking in 2011, with fluctuations in subsequent years.
- **Seasonal Production Comparison**: Kharif season leads with the highest production, followed by Rabi, winter, summer, and autumn.
- **State-wise Insights**: Kerala tops in crop production, driven by high coconut yields. Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu also show significant production due to coconut cultivation.
- **Top 5 Crop Area vs. Production Analysis**: Coconut has the highest production despite less area, followed by sugarcane, rice, wheat, and potato.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Tableau Desktop**: Used for creating dynamic visualizations and a storytelling dashboard.
- **Excel**: Employed for initial data cleaning, including removing null values and ensuring data integrity.
